This project contains the detailed results of benchmarks performed in the security tools benchmarking blog (sectooladdict).
The results of each benchmark are provided within multiple PDF files, which include articles, tables and charts.

Updated results can be found at <b><a href='http://www.sectoolmarket.com/'>SecToolMarket</a></b> - a website that presents the results of a dynamically updated security benchmark.
